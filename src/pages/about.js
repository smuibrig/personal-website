                <h3>How a became a programmer</h3>
                <p className="about-section">
                    My interest in programming first sparked while finishing my
                    MA in Communications and Linguistics in 2019, when I
                    enrolled in a Computational Linguistics course. The course
                    entailed natural language processing with python. Back then
                    I wrote my first lines of code and got a first hunch of how powerful a tool this is.
                </p>
                <p className="about-section">
                    After gaining some professional experience in Communications
                    and Marketing in the Berlin tech sector, I decided, that I
                    would like to get my hands dirty and build technologies,
                    rather than market them.
                </p>
                <p className="about-section">
                    So in the beginning of 2020 I quit my job to fully commit to
                    learn how to build web apps. As a linguist I put careful
                    consideration into which language to focus on at this stage.
                    JavaScript made the cut since it is used to build the web's
                    UI and it's also a valid backend language.
                </p>
                <p className="about-section">
                    Since Web Development comprises of a number of different frameworks and libraries and offers countless resources to learn them, I finally came to a point where sought guidance in my very personal study endevour. So I did my research and decided to enroll at SPICED Academy, an intense three months WebDev bootcamp based in Berlin.

                <p className="about-section">
                    After building my first full stack web apps, working with third party APIs and using frontend frameworks such as React.js, Vue.js and Gatsby, I'm ready to learn more on a job from exprienced developers, who enjoy to mentor an avid learner like myself.
