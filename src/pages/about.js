                    My interest in coding first sparked while finishing my MA in
                    Communications and Linguistics in 2019, when I enrolled in a
                    Computational Linguistics course. It entailed natural
                    language processing with python. Back then I wrote my first
                    lines of code and got a hunch of how powerful a tool
                    programming is.

                    After gaining some professional experience in Communications
                    and Marketing in the Berlin tech sector, I decided that I
                    would like to get my hands dirty and build technologies,
                    rather than market them.

                    So in the beginning of 2020 I quit my job to fully commit to
                    learn how to program and build web apps. As a linguist I put
                    careful consideration into which language to focus on at
                    this stage. JavaScript made the cut: is one of the core
                    technologies of the web, it is the only programming language
                    that enables interactive web pages. With the help of
                    cross-platform runtime engines like Node.js also server-side
                    code can be written in JavaScript.

                    Since Web Development comprises a number of different
                    frameworks and libraries and offers countless resources to
                    learn them, I finally came to a point where I sought
                    guidance in my very personal study endeavour. So I did my
                    research and decided to enroll at SPICED Academy, an intense
                    three months WebDev bootcamp based in Berlin.

                    After building my first full stack web apps, working with
                    third party APIs and using frontend frameworks such as
                    React.js, Vue.js and Gatsby I'm ready to learn more on a job
                    from experienced developers, who enjoy to mentor an avid
                    learner like myself.
